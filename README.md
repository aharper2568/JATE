# J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor)

## Intro
The J.A.T.E is a web based application that serves as a text editor. It can take in text and save it to memory to be returned to later. Functionalities have been added to make it an installable PWA that works offline.

## Usage
This applcation is deployed using Render, a link can be found below; however, the following are instructions for users wishing to test the application themselves:
- Copy this repository
- Run the following commands: 
- `npm i`
- `npm run start:dev`
- Note that running the server locally on Chrome has shown bugs in the installation feature, running locally on Opera does not.
